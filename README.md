# BS-EN-15804-impacts-considering-grid-decarbonisation-trajectories
Open source Python tool for calculating environmental impacts in accordance with BS EN 15804:2012+A2:2019, enabling assessment of materials manufactured in future accounting for grid decarbonisation pathways.

To use this tool follow the 
1. Make sure all required files (Future_impacts_calculator) are downloaded and safely stored in your Downloads folder
2. Export the process contribution inventory from SimaPro in default units
3. Paste it in cell A1 of "Paste results here" sheet found in "impacts to subtract.xlsx" spreadsheet.
4. Save the spreadsheet
5. Run the impacts of future material manufacturing python code by selecting the desired decarbonisation pathway. For details on the pathways and the mapping of scenarios please refer  to the relevant publication

The tool is part of the following publication:
